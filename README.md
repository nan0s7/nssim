This script does not interact with any NVIDIA driver whatsoever.

The goal of this script is to allow simple programming and debugging to be able to take place away from a computer that has an NVIDIA graphics card, and is using the propriatary drivers.

Although very simple right now, I'm hoping to make it more complex in the future.
